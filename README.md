# calculator-js

Aims of this project:
- A calculator web page
- Utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Basic mathematical functions, such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication
- Error and event handling
- DOM manipulation

What I learned and used:
- Strengthed use of DOM manipulation
- Adding logic to JS code
- Adding features such as flags for display

Future things I'll avoid:
- Cleaning up event handlers, as this currently takes up a bulk of code...
- Simpler use of code, such as removing need for flags
- Cleaner and simpler use of functions, nesting if statements less
- Relying more on Switch statements when they're better used than IF statements
